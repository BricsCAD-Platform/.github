## About BricsCAD
BricsCAD is a comprehensive computer-aided design (CAD) platform built for professionals who require robust drafting and modeling capabilities without vendor lock-in. It delivers a familiar command-line and interface experience for users transitioning from other major CAD systems, while incorporating innovative features like its AI-powered "Blockify" tool that automatically converts generic geometry into reusable, intelligent blocks. At its heart is a powerful, multi-threaded modeling engine that provides exceptional performance for both 2D detailing and complex 3D assemblies, all while maintaining 100% compatibility with the industry-standard .dwg file format.

The platform distinguishes itself through its flexible, modular approach. The core BricsCAD Pro offers extensive 2D drafting and 3D modeling, while add-ons like BricsCAD BIM, Mechanical, and Platinum cater to specific vertical markets with specialized toolsets. This includes everything from generating construction documentation and IFC export for BIM to parametric constraints and bill of materials for mechanical design. With features like a built-in LISP interpreter, COM API, and .NET support, BricsCAD also provides deep customization and automation options, making it a versatile choice for architectural firms, engineering consultants, manufacturers, and CAD managers looking for a cost-effective, high-performance alternative.
